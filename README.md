# PayDayPlanner Support

Welcome to the official support page for PayDayPlanner - the smart debt payoff calculator for iOS.

## 📱 About PayDayPlanner

PayDayPlanner helps you crush debt faster by calculating the optimal payment amount for each debt every payday. No more spreadsheets, no more guessing - just enter your debts and paycheck, and get a clear payment plan.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Add Your Debts**: Enter each debt with its current balance, minimum payment, and interest rate
2. **Enter Your Paycheck**: Add your paycheck amount and any bills you need to pay first
3. **Get Your Plan**: PayDayPlanner calculates exactly how much to pay on each debt
4. **Track Progress**: Watch your debts decrease with visual progress charts

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### How does PayDayPlanner calculate payments?
PayDayPlanner uses the debt avalanche method by default, paying minimums on all debts then applying extra money to the highest interest rate debt first. This mathematically minimizes the total interest paid.

### Is my financial data secure?
Yes! All data is stored locally on your device only. PayDayPlanner never sends your information to any servers. We cannot see your data, and it's protected by your device's security features.

### Can I track debts for multiple people?
Yes! You can assign debts to different household members and track them separately while still optimizing total payments.

### What happens if I can't afford all minimum payments?
PayDayPlanner will show you which minimums to prioritize and alert you if your paycheck doesn't cover all required minimums.

### Can I export my payment plan?
Yes, you can export your payment plan to share with a partner or keep for your records.

### Does PayDayPlanner work offline?
Yes! The app works 100% offline. No internet connection required.
